# Car Rental Website

This is a car rental website built using React, NestJS, GraphQL, Postgres, and NodeJS. The website allows users to rent cars by filling out a form. Currently, the search engine and the buy car option are not available but will be added soon.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need
- Postgres: An open-source relational database management system
- NodeJS: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side

## Installation

To get started with the website, you will need to have NodeJS and Postgres installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
3. Create a Postgres database and update the `ormconfig.json` file with your database credentials
4. Run the migrations to create the required tables by running the command `npm run typeorm:run`
5. Start the server by running the command `npm run start:dev`
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the website

## Usage

Once you have the website running, you can navigate to the homepage and fill out the form to rent a car. Currently, the search engine and buy car options are not available but will be added soon.
